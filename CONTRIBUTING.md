# Contributing to the Model Management Challenge

## Guidelines for Contributing Artifacts

We welcome contributions of artifacts that represent the same semantics as the existing models but in different formalisms. For example, you could contribute:

- An ontology in a different language (e.g., OWL, RDF, UML, SysML, etc.)
- A system configuration in a different format (e.g., XML, YAML, etc.)
- Requirements in a different notation
- Reports in a different format

When contributing alternative artifacts, please ensure:

1. **Semantic Preservation**
   - Clearly describe how your artifact maintains the same semantics as the original
   - Explain the mapping between your formalism and the original
   - Document any semantic differences or extensions

2. **Model Meaning**
   - Provide a clear explanation of what your model represents
   - Describe the domain concepts and their relationships
   - Explain any assumptions or constraints

3. **Documentation**
   - Include a README explaining your formalism choice
   - Provide examples of how to use/interpret your artifact
   - Document any tools or libraries needed to work with your artifact

## Guidelines for Contributing Stories

We welcome new stories that demonstrate different model management challenges. Your story should:

1. **Artefact Involvement**
   - Clearly identify which artifacts are involved
   - Describe what changes occur to these artifacts
   - Explain how the artifacts interact or depend on each other

2. **Real-world Motivation**
   - Provide a realistic scenario from systems engineering
   - Explain why this scenario is important
   - Describe the stakeholders involved

3. **Model Management Implications**
   - Explain the model management challenges in your story
   - Describe how these challenges affect the artifacts
   - Discuss potential solutions or approaches

4. **Relation to Model Management**
   - Connect your story to broader model management concepts
   - Explain how it relates to existing stories
   - Describe what new insights it provides
